# Readme: project download

Since the Unreal Project is to large for GitHub to upload, I've created a shared google drive folder with my game project.

You can download this [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LIJaIbXCQJ6zP57FjkKtOJHGoR11Lm2e/view?usp=sharing)

It's a basic zipfile that you can unpack and then open with Unreal Engine v5.0.3

(next time I will directly create the project in GitHub so that the upload amount does not exceed the GitHub values)
