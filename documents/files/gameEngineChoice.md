# What game engine am I going to use? 

## Unreal Engine VS Unity

When it comes to choosing a game engine it's a pretty straight forward choice.
Either go with Unreal engine or Unity for projects like this.

In this document I will shortly discuss both and infrom you why I have made my choice.

## Unreal Engine

### Advantages
* Simple to use interface
* Allows you to create a game without having to "write" a single line of code
* Whole library full of extentions, plugins, assets, etc.
* Fast rendering technology
* Pre-build templates to give you a headstart in otherwise tedious tasks
* Whole list of exportable packages (e.g. Linux, Windows, Android, ...)
* Very active community with plenty of tutorials, guides, forms, ...

### Disadvantages 
* Heavy on your system (in my experience it crashed a couple of times)
* UE5 removed direct integration with HTML
* A bit to powerful for my usecase(s)

### Expected requirments before using
* Basic game development knowledge
* Basic C++ knowledge

## Unity

### Advantages
* Better platform if you want to work in team (easier to setup)
* Better choice for Indi games since it royalty free
* Massive library of plugins, assets, ... to inhance the capabilities
* Since Unity has existed for longer the support community is bigger than that of UE
* Easier on your machine since it's less graphically advanced as ue5

### Disadvantages 
* Best features of Unity are locked behind the Unity Pro version. Which can get very expensive
* No open source code 
* Slower render times than UE5
  
### Expected requirments before using
* Basic game development knowledge
* Basic C# and JScript knowledge

## Conclusion

Personally I have decided on using UE5. <br>
While Unity would seem like the better choice since my game is rather small scale and most certainly not a AAA game, I have my reasons for choosing UE5.

My main reasons are: 
1. I'm still very interested in gamedevelopment and getting to use the new ue5 engine is an amazing learning opportunity
2. UE5 is totally free via Epic Games while for Unity I would have to request a Pro version which would just add an extra step
3. I've already dabbled in UE4 before so I can use my previously learned things in this project.
4. Project packaging and exporting is really really easy in UE5
5. Itch.io is a very very solid integration platform for this.
